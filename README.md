## BDS02 - Spring Boot framework code for _CRUD_ functions using _REST_ api to handle information of two simple entities with one-to-many relationship.

The code is the result of the task assignment where is requested to build _CRUD_ features according to integration tests in files **EventControllerIT.java** and **CityControllerIT.java.**
The initial code can be seen on https://github.com/devsuperior/bds02 repository.
The proposed task is based on **_TDD_** methodology. Test-driven development (_TDD_) is a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed, and tracking all software development by repeatedly testing the software against all test cases. This is as opposed to software being developed first and test cases created later.
The H2 database was seeded with a previous configuration file (**data.sql**).
This delivery fulfills task assignment required to pass second module of Spring Boot Bootcamp course from https://devsuperior.com.br
